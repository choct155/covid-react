# COVID-19 Visualization

Courtesy of the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com), there is a good source of updated, count-level, COVID-19 data available on Github. Couple that with my own interest in learning more about JavaScript (specifically the use of [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org), [Plotly.js](https://plotly.com/javascript/), and [D3.js](https://d3js.org) for interactive graphics) and we have a nice basis for a repo. Note also that I'm not trying to deal with errors I don't have to encounter, so I'll be using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) for all of it.
